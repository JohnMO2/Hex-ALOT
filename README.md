# Hex-ALOT
A hexapedal robot I am making

I will upload the design files sometime soon.

Scripts:
The only scripts that I have uploaded so far are just for the IK. The firmware and app will be uploaded sometime soon.
The scripts are still in development and have a ton of bugs. I recomend using the unity package if you are using this with unity as it comes with a scene with some of this already set up.
